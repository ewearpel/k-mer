NAME
    chi2 - chi2.py

DESCRIPTION
    This script performs chi-square tests on k-mer count tables (TSV files) and calculates Cramér's V as a measure of association.
    It produces a summary table of chi-square results for each k-mer size.

    Functions:
        cramers_v(chi2: float, n: int, r: int, c: int) -> float:
            Compute Cramér's V statistic based on chi-square, number of observations, and matrix dimensions.

        chi2_test(tsv_paths: list of str, table_inclusion_threshold: int) -> dict:
            Perform chi-square tests on k-mer count tables. Filter columns based on the inclusion threshold.

        chi2_results_table(chi2_dict: dict, output_path: str):
            Save the chi-square results (chi-square value, p-value, degrees of freedom, and Cramér's V) to a text file.

    Main Execution:
        Command-line arguments:
            1. table_inclusion_threshold (int): Minimum frequency required for k-mers to be included in the table.
            2. output_dir (str): Directory for saving the chi-square results.
            3. tsv_paths (list of str): Paths to the k-mer count TSV files.

        Workflow:
            1. Load k-mer count tables.
            2. Perform chi-square tests on the k-mer counts.
            3. Calculate Cramér's V.
            4. Save chi-square test results to a file.
