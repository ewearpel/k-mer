NAME
    analysis - analysis.py

DESCRIPTION
    This script calculates descriptive statistics for k-mer counts across species and generates boxplots for visualization.
    It processes k-mer count TSV files and sequence lengths to produce both raw and normalized statistics.

    Functions:
        calculate_descriptive_statistics(kmer_data) -> tuple[dict, dict]:
            Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance, std dev, max count) for each species
            from k-mer count data, both raw and normalized by sequence length.

        statistics_to_table(calculated_statistics: dict) -> pandas.DataFrame:
            Convert the calculated statistics into a pandas DataFrame for easy export or reporting.

        plot_statistic_boxplots(calculated_statistics: dict, output_folder: str, title_prefix: str = "Descriptive Statistics"):
            Generate boxplots for each k-mer size across species and save them as PNG files.

    Main Execution:
        Command-line arguments:
            1. output_dir_box (str): Directory for saving boxplots.
            2. output_dir_stats (str): Directory for saving statistics in JSON format.
            3. lengths_path (str): JSON file path containing the sequence lengths for each species.
            4. tsv_paths (list of str): Paths to the k-mer count TSV files.

        Workflow:
            1. Load sequence lengths and k-mer counts.
            2. Calculate descriptive statistics.
            3. Save statistics as JSON files.
            4. Plot boxplots for normalized statistics.
