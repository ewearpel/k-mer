NAME
    parse_input - parse_input.py

DESCRIPTION
    This script parses input DNA sequence files in FASTA format, handling both gzip-compressed and plain text files. It extracts sequences from multiple input files, storing them in a structured format, and saves the results in a JSON file.

    Functions:
        parse_input(file_paths: list[str]) -> list[dict]:
            Parses a list of input FASTA files and extracts sequences into a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains the filename and its associated sequences.

    Main Execution:
        Command-line arguments:
            1. output_file (str): Path where the output JSON file will be saved.
            2. filenames (list of str): List of paths to the input FASTA files to be processed.

        Workflow:
            1. Read sequences from the input FASTA files.
            2. Parse the sequences and store them in a structured format.
            3. Save the parsed sequences to a JSON file specified by the user.

FUNCTIONS
    parse_input(file_paths)
        Reads input files (FASTA format), parses them, and stores contained sequences in a list of lists.

        Args:
            file_paths (list of str): File paths obtained from command line arguments.

        Returns:
            input_data (list of dictionaries): Each dictionary corresponds to input file, contains filename
            and sequences.
